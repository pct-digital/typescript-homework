# Prerequisites

You need node installed on your local machine to work through these tutorials. It is best to use [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-and-updating) to manage node versions.

1. Install NVM as described in the link
1. `nvm install 20`
1. `node --version` should yield version 20
